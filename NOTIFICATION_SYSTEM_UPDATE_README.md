# Notification System Update v1.1.0

## Overview

This update enhances the notification system to provide more comprehensive device information and better classification through notification categories instead of simple types.

## Key Changes

### 1. Notification Schema Updates

#### Before (v1.0.0)
- Used simple `type` field with values: `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `SUCCESS`
- Limited device information in notifications
- Basic notification content

#### After (v1.1.0)
- **New `category` field** with comprehensive values:
  - `DEVICE_ASSIGNMENT` - Device assignment notifications
  - `DEVICE_CREATION` - Device creation notifications
  - `DEVICE_UPDATE` - Device update notifications
  - `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE` - Maintenance scheduling notifications
  - `MAINTENANCE_REMINDER` - Maintenance reminder notifications
  - `MAINTENANCE_ASSIGNMENT` - Maintenance task assignment notifications
  - `DEVICE_OFFLINE` - Device offline alerts
  - `DEVICE_ONLINE` - Device online status
  - `TEMPERATURE_ALERT` - Temperature threshold alerts
  - `BATTERY_LOW` - Battery level alerts
  - `RULE_TRIGGERED` - Rule execution notifications
  - `RULE_CREATED` - Rule creation notifications
  - `SYSTEM_UPDATE` - System update notifications
  - `SECURITY_ALERT` - Security-related alerts
  - `PERFORMANCE_ALERT` - Performance issue alerts
  - `SAFETY_ALERT` - Safety-related alerts
  - `CUSTOM` - Custom notifications

#### Enhanced Device Information Fields
- `device_name` - Device name
- `device_type` - Device type (SENSOR, ACTUATOR, GATEWAY, CONTROLLER)
- `device_location` - Device location
- `device_status` - Device status (ONLINE, OFFLINE, WARNING, ERROR)
- `maintenance_rules_count` - Number of active maintenance tasks
- `safety_rules_count` - Number of active safety precautions
- `total_rules_count` - Total number of configured rules
- `device_manufacturer` - Device manufacturer
- `device_model` - Device model

### 2. Notification Behavior Updates

#### Before (v1.0.0)
- Notifications were only sent if the assignee was different from the current user
- Limited device information in notification messages
- Basic notification content

#### After (v1.1.0)
- **Notifications are now sent to ALL assigned users**, including the current user
- **Enhanced notification content** with comprehensive device information
- **Better notification classification** for improved filtering and management
- **Rich device context** including maintenance rules, safety rules, and device specifications

### 3. New Services

#### DeviceNotificationEnhancerService
- Automatically enhances notifications with comprehensive device information
- Counts and includes maintenance rules, safety rules, and total rules
- Builds rich notification messages with device context
- Provides device statistics for notification enhancement

## Database Migration

### Migration Script
Run the migration script located at `backend/src/main/resources/migration-v1.1.0.sql` to update your existing database.

### Migration Steps
1. **Backup your database** before running the migration
2. **Run the migration script** in your PostgreSQL database
3. **Verify the migration** by checking that new columns exist
4. **Test the system** to ensure notifications work correctly

### Migration Commands
```sql
-- Connect to your database and run:
\i backend/src/main/resources/migration-v1.1.0.sql
```

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### Updated Models
- `Notification.java` - Added new fields and category enum
- `DeviceNotificationEnhancerService.java` - New service for notification enhancement

#### Updated Services
- `UnifiedOnboardingService.java` - Removed current user check, added notification enhancement
- `DeviceService.java` - Enhanced notifications with device information
- `DeviceController.java` - Updated notification creation
- `MaintenanceController.java` - Updated maintenance notifications
- `RuleService.java` - Updated rule creation notifications
- `NotificationService.java` - Updated to work with categories
- `NotificationSettingsService.java` - Added category to type mapping

#### Updated Schema
- `schema.sql` - Updated notifications table structure
- `migration-v1.1.0.sql` - Database migration script

### Frontend Changes

#### Updated Types
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated notification interface with new fields

#### Updated Services
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Updated to work with categories

## Usage Examples

### Creating Enhanced Notifications

```java
// Create a basic notification
Notification notification = new Notification();
notification.setTitle("New Device Assignment");
notification.setMessage("Device has been assigned to you.");
notification.setCategory(Notification.NotificationCategory.DEVICE_ASSIGNMENT);
notification.setUserId(assignedUserId);
notification.setDeviceId(deviceId);
notification.setOrganizationId(organizationId);

// Enhance with device information
deviceNotificationEnhancerService.enhanceNotificationWithDeviceInfo(
    notification, deviceId, organizationId);

// Build enhanced message
String enhancedMessage = deviceNotificationEnhancerService.buildEnhancedNotificationMessage(notification);
notification.setMessage(enhancedMessage);
```

### Notification Categories in Action

```java
// Device assignment notification
notification.setCategory(Notification.NotificationCategory.DEVICE_ASSIGNMENT);

// Maintenance task notification
notification.setCategory(Notification.NotificationCategory.MAINTENANCE_ASSIGNMENT);

// Rule creation notification
notification.setCategory(Notification.NotificationCategory.RULE_CREATED);

// Security alert notification
notification.setCategory(Notification.NotificationCategory.SECURITY_ALERT);
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience
- Users receive notifications for all assigned devices, even if they created them
- Rich device context helps users understand what they're being notified about
- Better notification organization through categories

### 2. Improved Notification Management
- Categories allow for better filtering and organization
- Enhanced device information provides context for decision-making
- Better notification preferences management

### 3. Enhanced Device Context
- Users can see device specifications, rules, and maintenance information
- Better understanding of device status and configuration
- Improved troubleshooting and maintenance planning

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Device Assignment** - Verify notifications are sent to all assigned users
2. **Notification Enhancement** - Verify device information is included
3. **Category Classification** - Verify notifications use correct categories
4. **Migration** - Verify existing notifications are properly migrated

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test notification creation
curl -X POST /api/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","category":"DEVICE_ASSIGNMENT","userId":"user123"}'

# Verify notification enhancement
curl -X GET /api/notifications/{id}
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Restoring the database backup** from before migration
2. **Reverting code changes** to the previous version
3. **Restarting services** with the previous configuration

## Support

For issues or questions regarding this update:

1. Check the migration logs for any errors
2. Verify database schema changes were applied correctly
3. Test notification creation and enhancement functionality
4. Review application logs for any runtime errors

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Notification templates for different categories
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Notification analytics and reporting
- Push notification support for enhanced notifications
- Email notification templates with device information
